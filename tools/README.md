## Above-Below Custom Functions & Tools

A secondary pursuit of this group is the creation of functions and tools that are useful in aligning above and belowground data collected in the same time/space from data providers with an internally-standardized data format (e.g., [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/)).

These tools are housed here for now though if they reach 'critical mass' an R package is not unlikely.
